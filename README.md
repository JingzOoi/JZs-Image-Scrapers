# image-board-extensions
An improvised version of my other repo here https://github.com/JingzOoi/JZs-Web-Scrapers. Less text, more returns.
Made this repo because that other one had too much unnecessary stuff I've added in over the weeks that I can't fix. It still works, just looks terrible.

Aiming to have this version print nothing from their extension files, just returns the values that you need. Made the GUI main file if you don't want to work in the command line. Won't judge.

# Currently supports:
<ol>
    <li> pixiv.net </li>
    <li> nhentai.net </li>
</ol>

# Limitations:
Pixiv doesn't allow un-logined clients to view r-18 or copyrighted data, so that's a no go.
